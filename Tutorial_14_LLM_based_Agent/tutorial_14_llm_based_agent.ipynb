    "# LLM-Based Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-based agents leverage the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT, to perform complex tasks by understanding and generating human-like text. These agents are increasingly used in applications like virtual assistants, content generation, customer support, and decision-making systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an LLM-Based Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM-based agent is a software system that integrates a pretrained language model with additional components to perform specific tasks autonomously. These agents process natural language inputs, generate meaningful responses, and often interact with external systems to execute actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **LLM Core**: The pretrained large language model that understands and generates text.  \n",
    "2. **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Adapts the LLM to a particular domain or task using specialized datasets.  \n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: Connects the agent with external tools (e.g., APIs, databases) to enhance functionality.  \n",
    "4. **Memory and Context Handling**: Allows the agent to maintain context across interactions, enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How LLM-Based Agents Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Processing**: The agent receives natural language input from the user.  \n",
    "2. **Model Inference**: The LLM generates a response or determines the next action based on the input.  \n",
    "3. **Action Execution**: If required, the agent performs an action, such as querying a database or invoking an API.  \n",
    "4. **Output Generation**: The agent delivers a response to the user, completing the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and Adaptation:\n",
    "- **Pretraining**: The base LLM is trained on a massive corpus of text, learning patterns, grammar, and general knowledge.  \n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning**: Task-specific fine-tuning helps the agent specialize in areas like medical consultation, coding assistance, or creative writing.  \n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Ensures the responses align with human expectations, improving quality and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of LLM-Based Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual Assistants**: Personalized support for scheduling, reminders, and general queries.  \n",
    "2. **Customer Service**: Handling inquiries, resolving issues, and automating responses.  \n",
    "3. **Content Creation**: Generating articles, summaries, or creative works like stories and poetry.  \n",
    "4. **Decision Support**: Assisting professionals in fields like law, healthcare, and finance by providing insights and recommendations.  \n",
    "5. **Coding Assistance**: Aiding developers by generating code snippets, debugging, or answering programming-related questions."

    "# How to Obtain an OpenAI API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to get your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create or Log In to Your OpenAI Account\n",
    "- Visit the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).\n",
    "- If you don’t have an account, click **Sign Up** to create one.\n",
    "- If you already have an account, click **Log In** to access your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Go to the API Keys Page\n",
    "- After logging in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.\n",
    "- Select **\"View API Keys\"** from the dropdown menu or go directly to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Generate a New Key\n",
    "- On the API Keys page, click the **\"Create new secret key\"** button.\n",
    "- A new API key will be generated and displayed on the screen. **Copy this key immediately** and save it securely (it will only be shown once).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Important Notes\n",
    "- Treat your API key as a secret and do not share it publicly.\n",
    "- Avoid hardcoding the key directly in your code. Instead, use environment variables or a secret management tool.\n",
    "- Ensure your account has **Billing** enabled to access paid services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Using the Key\n",
    "Once you have your API key, you can use it in your projects to access OpenAI's features, such as GPT models, image generation, or other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "\n",
    "openai.api_key = \"your-api-key-here\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "print(response.choices[0].text.strip())\n",
    "```\n",

We know that he spends 2 hours on sports activities every day, and he goes to school 5 days a week. This means that he spends 2 x 5 = 10 hours on sports in school every week.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m find the net profit from Burt's basil plants.
