# Tutorial 5: CNN in Practice

This repository contains two tutorials showcasing practical applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Tutorials Overview

### 1. CNN in Practice with TensorFlow
This tutorial demonstrates:
- **Feature Extraction**: Reusing a pre-trained CNN on a new dataset, a useful approach when working with small datasets.
- **Visualization of Learned Concepts**: 
  - Intermediate ConvNet outputs.
  - Filters in ConvNets.
  - Heatmaps of class activation (GradCAM).

*Note*: The tutorial concludes with a feature extraction example, with fine-tuning covered in the next lecture.

### 2. CNN in Practice with PyTorch
This tutorial covers the same concepts as the TensorFlow tutorial, implemented using PyTorch:
- **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging pre-trained models for small datasets.
- **Visualization of Learned Concepts**: 
  - Intermediate ConvNet outputs.
  - ConvNet filters.
  - GradCAM-based class activation heatmaps.
