# Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This guide introduces two versions of the GNN tutorial, implemented with PyTorch. Below is an overview and instructions for each tutorial.

---

## **Overview**
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized deep learning models designed to handle graph-structured data. These tutorials demonstrate how to:
- Build a GNN model
- Load and process graph data
- Train the model and evaluate its performance

---

## **Tutorial**
- **Framework**: Implements GNNs using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
- **Key Features**:
  - Data Processing: Load and manipulate graph data with PyG tools.
  - Model Building: Define GNN layers and overall architecture using PyTorch.
  - Model Training: Utilize PyTorch training loops and analyze results.

- **Target Audience**:
  - Users familiar with PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.
  - Those looking to efficiently use PyG for graph learning tasks.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Required Libraries**:
   - PyTorch implementation requires PyTorch >= 1.10 and PyTorch Geometric.

2. **Hardware**:
   - GPU support is recommended to accelerate model training.

3. **Installation Commands**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio torch-geometric
   ```
