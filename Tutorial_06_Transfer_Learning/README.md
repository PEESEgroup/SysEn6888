# Transfer Learning Tutorials

This repository contains two tutorials on transfer learning, focusing on TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.

## Tutorial 1: Transfer Learning with TensorFlow
**File**: `Tutorial#6 (tf) Transfer_learning.ipynb`

This tutorial demonstrates transfer learning using TensorFlow. Key highlights include:
- Leveraging pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub.
- Fine-tuning specific layers to adapt to a custom dataset.
- Practical guidance on optimizing training parameters.

## Tutorial 2: Transfer Learning with PyTorch
**File**: `Tutorial#6 (torch) Transfer_learning.ipynb`

This tutorial illustrates transfer learning in PyTorch. Key features covered:
- Using models from `torchvision.models` with pre-trained weights.
- Freezing layers for efficient training on smaller datasets.
- Step-by-step implementation for model adaptation.
