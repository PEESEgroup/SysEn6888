## Introduction

Object detection answers the question, "What is in the image?" This tutorial uses YOLO for efficient and accurate detection and segmentation. For more details, watch this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/lxLyLIL7OsU).

---

## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries before starting:
- `ultralytics` (latest version)
- `torch`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`
- `matplotlib`

```bash
pip install ultralytics torch numpy Pillow matplotlib
```

---

## Setup

1. Load and preprocess images using the provided helper functions.
2. Utilize YOLO models for detection and segmentation.
3. Configure confidence and IoU thresholds for better accuracy.

---

## Object Detection

1. **Preparing the Image**: Load and preprocess input images.
2. **Performing Detection**: Use a pretrained YOLO model to detect objects.
3. **Visualizing Results**: Overlay bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores on the input image.

---

## Instance Segmentation

1. **Performing Segmentation**: Extract instance masks, bounding boxes, and labels.
2. **Visualizing Segmentation**: Save and display results with segmentation overlays.

Key function:
```python
def perform_segmentation(model, image):
    # Perform instance segmentation on the input image
    pass
```

---

## Results

All detection and segmentation results, including processed images, will be saved for further analysis. The tutorial also demonstrates how to adjust thresholds to refine the outcomes.

## Acknowledgments

This tutorial uses YOLO via the `ultralytics` package and integrates PyTorch for efficient computation.
