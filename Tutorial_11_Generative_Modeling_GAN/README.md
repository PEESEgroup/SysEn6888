# Generative Modeling with GANs

This repository contains two tutorials on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), implemented in TensorFlow and PyTorch. These tutorials guide you through building, training, and evaluating GANs for generative modeling tasks.

## Tutorials Overview

### 1. TensorFlow GAN Tutorial
- **File**: `Tutorial#11 (tf) Generative Modeling GAN.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook covers the implementation of GANs using TensorFlow. It introduces the fundamental concepts, architecture, and training strategies for GANs.
- **Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7 or above
  - TensorFlow 2.x
  - NumPy, Matplotlib
  
### 2. PyTorch GAN Tutorial
- **File**: `Tutorial#11 (torch) Generative Modeling GAN.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook provides an implementation of GANs using PyTorch. It walks through similar concepts as the TensorFlow version but uses PyTorch’s dynamic computation graph and custom training loops.
- **Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7 or above
  - PyTorch 1.x or later
  - NumPy, Matplotlib

## Features
- **Step-by-step explanations**: Detailed comments and guidance throughout the notebooks.
- **Hands-on practice**: Implement your own GANs and modify the code as you explore.
- **Comparison of frameworks**: See how GANs are implemented differently in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
